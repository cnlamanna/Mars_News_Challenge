# Mars_News_Challenge

Challenge:
Extracting information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. Scraping HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage
This new assignment consists of two technical products:
Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

### side note
While trying to figure out the Earth to Martian days I created another data type ('year') with a dtype of int64, I left it in as it did not affect the overall answers
