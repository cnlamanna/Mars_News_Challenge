# Mars_News_Challenge
Although I finished this in one sitting, I admit I did have some trouble on part 2. 
thankfully I realized I was just tired and was overthinking it (haha) and once I walked away for a moment I thought of the answers!!

### side note
While trying to figure out the Earth to Martian days I created another data type ('year') with a dtype of int64, I left it in as it did not affect the overall answers
